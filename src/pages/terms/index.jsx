        <h3>Acclimatization is key</h3>
        <p>
          Leh is situated at an elevation of 11,500 feet above sea level, making
          it difficult for your body to adjust to the lower levels of oxygen as
          soon as you arrive. Day 1 in Leh can make or break your tour. Do not
          underestimate the importance of acclimatization at any cost. It is
          important to take your time and not try to do too much too soon on Day
          1. Drink plenty of water to help your body adjust to the altitude.
          Avoid alcohol, smoking, and caffeine, as they can interfere with your
          body's ability to acclimatize. A down feather jacket is a must for
          everyone on tour. Bike rides, especially in Changthang, are deemed
          impossible without a down jacket.

        <h3>Luxury is not a thing in Changthang</h3>
        <p>
          Destinations can vary in terms of the levels of luxury and comfort
          they offer. Leh and Nubra Valley are moderately comfortable in terms
          of accommodation and amenities. Pangong Tso, Hanle, and Tso Moriri are
          harsh and rustic. Please do not expect even an ounce of luxury in
          these places. Getting to sleep on a bed with a mattress, an attached
          washroom with running cold water, and a bucket of hot water upon
          request is what luxury could sound like in Changthang. We intend to
          help you set clear expectations.
          <br />
          Airport pickup will happen in groups of three or four. You might have
          to wait for fellow group travelers to arrive before getting
          transferred to the hotel.
          <br />
          Aadhaar card and Driving license are mandatory for drivers. Pillion
          riders need to furnish an Aadhaar card upon arrival.
          <br />
          On Day 1, the arrangement of a cab to the main market from the hotel
          will NOT be free of cost. Standard charges will be applicable.
          <br />
          It's indispensable to be mindful of your actions and how they might
          affect others when traveling. It's always a good idea to be respectful
          and considerate of your fellow travelers and to be a positive
          contributor to the travel experience for everyone. Inappropriate
          behavior can include a range of actions that are disrespectful, rude,
          or offensive.
          <br />

          expelled from the tour.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In case of an irreparable breakdown at a point, a spare bike won't be
          made available to the rider. The rider will travel in the backup
          vehicle until the same bike is made available again.
          <br />
          Due to the dynamic nature of fixed departure tours, members of one
          group might end up staying in different hotels. Any complaints
          regarding the same will not be entertained.
          <br />
          Chanthang Bike Tours will not be responsible for death or accidents
          that may occur during the tour.
          <br />
          You must follow the guidance and instructions of the tour captain, as
          he is responsible for the safety and well-being of the group. Tour
          captains are trained professionals who have a wealth of knowledge
          about the destination and the specific tour, and they are there to
          ensure that the tour runs smoothly and safely.
          <br />
          You must follow the instructions and guidance of the tour captain in
          the event of bad weather, as the captain is responsible for the safety
          and well-being of the group. This may include wearing appropriate
          clothing and being prepared to adjust to changes in the itinerary.
          <br />
          Rash driving or driving under the influence is strictly intolerable.
