      overview={`Highest road on the planet, as the name implies, is all about accomplishment. The excursion requires a ride to Umling La, a dizzying mountain pass that rises 19,300 feet above sea level and is higher than Mount Everest Base Camp. Let that sink in! Despite how difficult the task may seem, it may actually be accomplished pretty easily because of the region's reliable infrastructure. The journey also includes the breathtaking town of Leh, the thrilling ride to the Sham Valley, the alluring Nubra Valley, the breathtaking Pangong Lake, and the quaint settlement of Hanle.`}
