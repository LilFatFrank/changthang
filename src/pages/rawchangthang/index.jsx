      overview={`Raw Changthang, as the name suggests, takes you to some of the most remote regions of Ladakh. In addition to the town of Leh, Sham Valley, Nubra Valley, Turtuk, and Pangong Lake, the exploration takes you to Changthang- the land of nomads. Changthang is a high-altitude plateau situated at an elevation of around 14,000 feet above sea level and is known for its rugged, remote landscape, which includes mountains, glaciers, and lakes. The journey is a raw experience that would allow you to immerse in a lifestyle you have never experienced before as you visit the quaint village of Hanle, the formidable Umling La, and the most beautiful lake in the region- Tso Moriri. It is believed that hundreds of years ago, residents of the town of Leh would make the rigorous journey to Changthang on foot to fetch salt.`}
